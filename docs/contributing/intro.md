## Non-code contributions

Contributions are not necessarily programming related. There are multiple things outside of code contributions. Have a look at this article listing them: [Non code contributions to open-source](https://navendu.me/posts/non-code-contributions-to-open-source/).

## Reporting a security issue

Security issues must be reported through the proper channel. Please see this page: https://www.deltablot.com/security/.

## Translating

![internationalization](/img/i18n.webp)

Do you know several languages? Are you willing to help localize eLabFTW? You're in the right place.

How to translate?

* [Join the project on poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=aeeef61cdad663825bfe49bb7cbccb30)
* Select elabftw
* Select one or several languages (open a GitHub issue if your language is not present)
* Start translating
* Ignore things like `<strong>, <br>, %s, %d` and keep the punctuation like it was!

Translations are merged in the code before a release. You must not try and edit the .po/.mo files directly in the source code.
