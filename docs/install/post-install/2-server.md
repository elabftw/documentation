# Server tab

In this first tab, you can configure various settings for your instance.

### Language

Select the default language for the server, which will be the language assigned to new users and the one for unauthenticated pages (login/register pages). Users can then select a different language afterwards, for their own account.

### Address of the proxy

Configure a proxy address if external connections require going through one.

### URLs for Support and Chat

These URL can be modified, they appear in the top bar on the left, in the menu with the interrogation point icon. For example, the support URL could be your internal ticketing system, and the chat URL could be your internal discussion space.

### Permission settings

Each entry in eLabFTW has a «Base Permission» that can then be extended by adding Teams, Groups or Users. This section allows you to disable some of these permissions. For instance, in some context it is necessary to prevent the «Only owner» base permission, so Admins have always access to entries. You might also want to disable «Everyone with an account» and «Everyone including anonymous users» if you wish to prevent accidental leaking of entries to other teams.

Note that by default Anonymous users are disabled, so these two permissions have the same effect.
