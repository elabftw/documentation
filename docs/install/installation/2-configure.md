# Configure services

Start the configuration wizard with:

~~~bash
elabctl install
~~~

This will help you configure the services and create a configuration file (`/etc/elabftw.yml` by default).

After this initial setup, you need to edit that file to configure persistent storage, TLS certificates, ports, proxies, etc...

The file is heavily commented to help with this.
