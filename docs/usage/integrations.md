# Integrations with external services

## PubChem

The [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database is directly integrated in eLabFTW on the Compounds page. It allows users to import chemical compounds in eLabFTW with information such as:

- CAS Number
- Molecular formula
- Molecular weight
- InChI
- SMART
- Hazard information
- and many more properties

## Bloxberg

The [Bloxberg](https://bloxberg.org/) blockchain is integrated in eLabFTW. Click the blockchain button from the main toolbar of an entry to add its hash to the blockchain and get a Research Object Certificate back.

## Keeex

eLabFTW provides a way to use a [Keeex](https://keeex.me/) service during the timestamp action. It is a technology that allows to guarantee integrity and authenticity of files, autonomously and without third party.

When enabled, the generated pdf for timestamping will be sent over to a Keeex Fusion service running on your network in http mode for keeex/timestamping of the pdf, before being timestamped via your RFC3161 provider.

If you would like to use this service, please [contact us](https://www.deltablot.com/contact).
