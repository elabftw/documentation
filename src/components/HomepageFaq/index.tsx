          You also have to consider the fact that installing eLabFTW on your own server means that
          no one will be able to snoop on your data. If you have ever used Evernote or basically any
          online ELN that says «Free», read carefully the privacy policy, you might be surprised

          Consider that there are thousands of eLabFTW instances worldwide.

          In France, it's the ELN of choice for the CNRS, the 1st largest research organization in
          Europe, along with many other universities and research institutes. It is also useful
          to startups and companies. You'll also find a lot of instances in German institutions, along with many other countries all around the world.

          The data is encrypted when travelling from your browser to the server with the highest quality encryption currently available (TLSv1.2/1.3 with modern ciphers). The passwords are not recoverable in case of a breach and are hashed using state of the art algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to have data at rest encryption, it needs to be done during the web server installation, and is not the concern of the software itself.

        <p>
          The following specification has been shown to perform well for an instance of several
          hundred daily users. The more users using the instance, the more CPU and RAM you'll need.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hardware</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          At least 2Gb of RAM, a decent processor ({">"} 2GHz), preferably multi-core and an SSD
          disk with at least a few Gb free.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Software</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The operating system of the server must be a flavor of GNU/Linux. We recommend Rocky
          Linux or RHEL.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service runs in containers (

          ), which are a Linux specific technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>MySQL</strong> database service is required. You can deploy a MySQL service with
          Docker by following the standard installation procedure, or use an existing separate MySQL
          server. Only <strong>MySQL</strong> is supported. Not PostgreSQL, not MariaDB, not SQLite.

          <strong>GMP Compliance Statement for eLabFTW</strong>
        </p>
        <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
        <p>
          eLabFTW is an open-source electronic lab notebook (ELN) and database designed for
          academic, industrial, and research institutions. This document outlines how eLabFTW
          complies with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements, particularly in contexts
          where digital recordkeeping must meet regulatory standards.
        </p>
        <h5>2. System Overview</h5>
        <p>eLabFTW provides features essential for compliance with GMP, including:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Comprehensive audit trails</li>
          <li>User authentication and access control</li>
          <li>Version control of records</li>
          <li>Role-based permission management</li>
          <li>Timestamped entries</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3. GMP-Relevant Compliance Features</h5>
        <h5>3.1 Data Integrity and Security</h5>
        <p>eLabFTW ensures data integrity through:</p>

          Nearly every action performed in eLabFTW is logged. The audit trail includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Timestamp of the action</li>
          <li>User identity</li>
          <li>Nature of the change (e.g., edit, delete)</li>
          <li>Linked records or experiments</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.3 User Management and Access Control</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Each user has a unique login with secure password requirements</li>
          <li>Role-based access controls limit user permissions</li>
          <li>Admins can assign and revoke roles</li>
          <li>Inactive users can be disabled to maintain access security</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.4 Electronic Signatures</h5>
        <p>eLabFTW supports electronic signatures that are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unique to each user</li>
          <li>Tied to a specific time and action</li>
          <li>Stored in immutable archives</li>
          <li>Using state of the art cryptography</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.5 Validation and Qualification</h5>
        <p>eLabFTW supports system validation through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open-source codebase (fully inspectable)</li>
          <li>Documented update logs and change management</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.6 Data Retention and Exportability</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Data can be exported in human-readable and machine-readable formats</li>
          <li>Archived data remains accessible and readable</li>
          <li>Long-term retention complies with GMP recordkeeping requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>4. Implementation Best Practices</h5>
        <p>To ensure GMP compliance, administrators should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement validated backup strategies</li>
          <li>Maintain system validation documentation</li>
          <li>Define and enforce access policies</li>
          <li>Perform regular audits using eLabFTW's built-in reporting tools</li>
          <li>Train users on GMP principles and proper usage of eLabFTW</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>5. Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          When properly configured and maintained, eLabFTW provides the necessary functionality to
          support GMP compliance in electronic documentation and laboratory recordkeeping
          environments.
